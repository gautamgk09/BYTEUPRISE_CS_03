The Caesar Cipher stands as one of the simplest and most renowned encryption techniques. It operates by shifting each letter in the plaintext message by a fixed number of positions up or down the alphabet. For instance, with a shift of 3, 'A' would become 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so forth.

Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher played a pivotal role in history, notably used by Julius Caesar to clandestinely communicate with his generals during military campaigns. It remains a foundational concept in cryptography, serving as the cornerstone for more intricate encryption algorithms.

Usage
Clone the repository:
Navigate to the project directory:
cd Caesar-Cipher-
Run the Python script:
python caesar_cipher.py
Follow the on-screen instructions:
Type 'encrypt' for encryption, 'decrypt' for decryption.
Enter your message.
Specify the shift key/number.
Repeat the process to encrypt/decrypt additional messages.
Type 'no' when prompted to quit the program.
Example:
ðŸŽ­ Welcome to Caesar Cipher ðŸŽ­

python

Type 'encrypt' for encryption, 'decrypt' for decryption:  
encrypt
Type your message: 
hello world
Type the shift number: 
3
ðŸ”’ Encrypting message...
